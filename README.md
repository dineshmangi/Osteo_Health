# Application of Machine Learning Algorithm for Osteoporosis Disease Prediction System
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Modeling using the Osteoporosis Dataset. The dataset contains medical and lifestyle factors associated with osteoporosis, which can help in early detection and prevention.

Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. Early detection through accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in reducing fractures and improving quality of life. This dataset consists of various clinical and lifestyle features used to classify individuals as having osteoporosis or normal bone density.
Perform EDA to understand the distribution of features in the dataset and identify missing values.
Handling Null Values using Imputation Technique
Identify key patterns and correlations between bone density and risk factors.
Encode data using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding (OHE).
Develop Machine Learning models to classify individuals as having Osteoporosis or Non-osteoporosis
Evaluate the model using key performance metrics such as Classification Report, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix, and 10-Fold Cross-Validation.
Analyze the best models for classification.
